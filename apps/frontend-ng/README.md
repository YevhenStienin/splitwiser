# SplitWiser

## Description:
Everyone knows the situation when you get together with friends to relax. Everyone has bought or prepared some food, snacks, drinks, or maybe ordered pizza. Everyone's having fun, and it's an unforgettable time. But sooner or later—usually the next day—the dreaded task arises: figuring out who spent how much and who owes whom money. How can you do this easily, conveniently, and accurately?

This small app is designed to solve that problem. Create events or gatherings, effortlessly add your expenses, view others’ expenses, and combine costs. No more headaches!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
